# National Water Dashboard @usgs @noaa


[drought.gov](https://www.drought.gov/data-maps-tools/national-water-dashboard) The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) National Water Dashboard is an interactive map viewer that shows provisional real-time stream, lake, reservoir, precipitation, water quality, and groundwater data from more than 13,500 USGS observation stations across the country. This information is shown along with NOAA weather data, such as radar, watches and warnings, past precipitation totals, precipitation forecasts, and drought conditions from other open water-data sources. The Dashboard also links to the USGS WaterAlert system, which sends out instant, customized updates about water conditions - [USGS Water Data for the Nation](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis) [CURRENT_CONDiTiONS](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis)
