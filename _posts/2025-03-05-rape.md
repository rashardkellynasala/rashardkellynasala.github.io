Sexual assault is a crime. It is defined as intentional sexual contact, characterized by use of force, physical threat or abuse of authority or when a person does not or cannot consent. For victims of sexual assault, the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response (SAPR) Office is available 24/7 to listen and uncover the best path to help with immediate crisis care, including medical, emotional and legal support. The SAPR Office completely supports the victim, not only when the unthinkable occurs, but guides them through the entire healing process which is unique to each individual.
