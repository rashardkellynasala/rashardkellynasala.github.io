Using BASH ::
The --posix option caught my attention this morning. I wonder how it will effect my approach to [The Unix Programming Environment](Â°)... I think i can make bash.md and start chronicling my growth with the shell. It was my first shell. it came bundled with the R[RedHat Linux Version]() then carried by [BestBuy](). Fedora Core 1 at [Tuscon Unified School District]() was my first professional jesture at using bash](). I always knew that to be a good linux user at work, i have to use it as my primary desktop. Tgat was the settinbg of the time. Windows was important because of the Authentication Schemes  you needed to login. How can i do both? in that era DualBoot. Today it dont matter as much bc most hardware you put your hands on has multithreading and virtualization extensions enabled by default.
